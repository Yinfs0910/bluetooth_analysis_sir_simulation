# bluetooth_analysis_sir_simulation

# Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-Python

-NetworkX

-EoN

-Matplotlib

-NumPy

-Pandas

# Program Details
-compare.py: You could compare the different results based on the bluetooth survey.

-generate_networks.py: You could generate any types of weighted networks based on the degree and weight distirbution as you like.

-load_adjacency.py: Loading the information of the networks generated by you saved in adjacent matrix.

-epidemic_threshold.py: Running the sir simulation on the weighted networks generated by you and check the  epidemic threshold base on the theoretical estimation.

-r_state_probability: Calculating the probability of one single node is in state R at final time.
